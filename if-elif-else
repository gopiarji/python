Got it 👍 Let’s go step by step on if-elif-else statements in Python.

🔹 Syntax
if condition1:
    # Code block if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code block if condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # Code block if condition3 is True
else:
    # Code block if none of the above are True


if → checked first

elif (else if) → checked only if previous conditions are False

else → runs if none of the conditions are True

🔹 Example 1: Simple Number Check
num = 10

if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")


✅ Output:

Positive number

🔹 Example 2: Grading System
marks = 72

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 50:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")


✅ Output:

Grade: B

🔹 Example 3: Even / Odd Check
num = 15

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")


✅ Output:

Odd


👉 Do you want me to also explain nested if-elif-else (conditions inside conditions) with examples?

Okay 👍 let me explain if-elif-else in Python very simply (befenly / beginner-friendly).

🟢 What is it?

Python uses if, elif, else to make decisions in a program.

It checks conditions (True / False).

Runs the first block that is True, then stops checking further.

🟢 Syntax (basic shape)
if condition1:
    # do this if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # do this if condition2 is True
else:
    # do this if nothing is True

🟢 Step by Step Example
Example 1: Checking number
num = 5

if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")


👉 How it works:

if num > 0 → 5 > 0 → True → prints Positive number

It does not check others after that.

Example 2: Age group
age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager")
else:
    print("You are a child")


✅ Output:

You are a teenager

Example 3: Marks grading
marks = 40

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade B")
elif marks >= 50:
    print("Grade C")
else:
    print("Fail")


✅ Output:

Fail


👉 So in short:

if → first check

elif → extra checks (else if)

else → final option (default)

Do you want me to also show you nested if-else (if inside another if)? That comes next after this.

Perfect 👍 let’s go deeper into if-elif-else in Python with more detailed beginner-friendly (befenly) explanation and examples.

🟢 1. Multiple elif Conditions

You can have many elif checks, but only one if and one else.

day = "Wednesday"

if day == "Monday":
    print("Start of the week")
elif day == "Friday":
    print("Weekend is near")
elif day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
    print("It's weekend!")
else:
    print("Just another weekday")


✅ Output:

Just another weekday

🟢 2. Using Comparison Operators

You can use <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=

num = 0

if num > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif num < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")


✅ Output:

Zero

🟢 3. Using Logical Operators (and, or, not)
age = 20

if age >= 18 and age < 60:
    print("Adult")
elif age >= 60:
    print("Senior Citizen")
else:
    print("Minor")


✅ Output:

Adult

🟢 4. Nested if-else (if inside another if)

Sometimes, you put an if inside another if.

num = 15

if num > 0:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Positive Even number")
    else:
        print("Positive Odd number")
else:
    print("Negative number or Zero")


✅ Output:

Positive Odd number

🟢 5. Short Form (Single line if-else) → Ternary Operator

If you want in one line:

num = 5
result = "Even" if num % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
print(result)


✅ Output:

Odd

🟢 6. Real Life Example
temperature = 35

if temperature > 40:
    print("It's too hot outside")
elif temperature >= 30:
    print("It's warm")
elif temperature >= 20:
    print("It's pleasant")
else:
    print("It's cold")


✅ Output:

It's warm


👉 So, if-elif-else is useful for decision making in Python.
You can:

Use comparison operators

Use logical operators

Use nested conditions

Even write it in one line
